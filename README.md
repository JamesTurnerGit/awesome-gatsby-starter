## Rational

If you've ever started building a larger website with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) which has multiple different UI elements and patterns, you may have ended up in a similar place I found myself - with some pretty massive component sprawl. I decided to try solve it by utilising storybook and building the required UI components up front in isolation before using them in the project.

What I ended up finding with this workflow was that this is a useful way of thinking about each websites UI; as a collection of components rather than one standard layout that does everything with a few bits on the side (...much like how we build apps as well).

The more I've applied it to the Gatsby sites I work on, the more easy I find it to manage, improve and maintain them by utilising this workflow of components first, project content second.

While this starter may be somewhat opinionated for what I want out of my Gatsby projects, it can quickly and easily be changed around with minimal effort - don't feel locked into what I've provided, it was only ever intended to be a rough guide for starting out.

## Features

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Airbnb's config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) integrated into ESLint
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for isolated component development
* [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for CSS-in-JS
* A few example components with stories and site structure
